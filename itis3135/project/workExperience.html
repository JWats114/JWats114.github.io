            <div class="resumePara">
                <p>Through my nursing coursework and clinical experiences, I developed a strong foundation in both the science and practice of patient care. Courses such as Anatomy & Physiology, Medical Terminology, and Holistic Care Concepts have given me a deep understanding of the human body, the language of healthcare, and the importance of treating each patient as a whole person rather than a diagnosis. These classes have strengthened my ability to recognize patient needs, communicate effectively with the healthcare team, and provide care that acknowledges the physical, emotional, and cultural aspects of health.</p>
                <p>In my clinical rotation, I had the opportunity to apply this knowledge in real patient-care settings, performing assessments, monitoring vital signs, assisting with mobility, and supporting daily living activities. Working alongside experienced nurses has taught me the value of compassion, attention to detail, and clear communication in delivering safe and effective care. The clinical experience has reinforced my commitment to patient advocacy and helped me grow in confidence as I continue developing my professional identity as a nurse. Together, these courses and hands-on experiences have encouraged me to approach nursing with empathy, curiosity, and a strong dedication to improving patients’ well-being.</p>
