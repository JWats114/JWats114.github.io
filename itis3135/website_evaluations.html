        <h1>Website Evaluations</h1>
        <h2>Good Website</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a></h3>
        <p>Amazon's website follows the CRAP principles. The website is clean and makes it very easy to navigate. The nav bar has multiple categories to follow and right above that is important information such as language, delivery options, and orders.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>C</b>rap: The contrast is prioritized at the top of the page with the dark blue contrasting wit tht white of the page where all the info is stored.</li>
            <li><b>R</b>epition: The repition is best applied to the products and how they are displayed exactly the same with the only wavering details depending on how users interact with said items.</li>
            <li><b>A</b>lignment: Everything is aligned in rows. Visual information is distributed throughout the page with the only item being off center is the search bar.</li>
            <li><b>P</b>roximity: There is consistently enough space to where products are not touching but not too much space that it feels like empty space.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Bad Website</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html">Daily Mail</a></h3>
        <p>The Daily Mail's website serves its purpose, however delivers poorly in regards to CRAP principles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>C</b>rap: The contrast on their page is poor. The sizing of the text and images are inconsistent, in turn making it difficult to tell what is of great importance and what is not. The text is also too hard to read as the font is too small.</li>
            <li><b>R</b>epition: The repition is better than their contrast, however it does little to redeem it due to the excessive clutter.</li>
            <li><b>A</b>lignment: The alignment is among the few things done correctly on this page as the text is all aligned to the left and images are correctly alinged with the text in relation to it.</li>
            <li><b>P</b>roximity: The proximity is over the worst principle on the Daily Mail's page. The site is incredibly cluttered and makes it hard to differentiate between differing articles. Every ounce of media is packed into one large wall, in turn making it much more difficult for a use to decipher.</li>
        </ul>
